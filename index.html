    <p>The FIFA World Cup is coming back to the United States, which will co-host alongside neighbors Canada and Mexico in 2026, making history as the first three host nation tournament. And it will be the biggest cup yet.</p>

    <p>The U.S. will be hosting a majority of the matches, as it's home to 12 of the 16 host stadiums FIFA announced recently. The country will join Mexico in becoming one of only five other countries to host more than one world final.</p>

    <p>The last time the World Cup was held in the U.S. was in 1994 when there were only 24 teams who competed in the tournament, with a total of 52 games being played. The following cup in France 1998 actually saw an expansion into its current format in which 32 teams play a total of 64 games.</p>

    <p>But despite the team and game expansion, the United States still holds the record for total attendance, nearly three decades later.</p>

    <iframe title="1994 FIFA World Cup still holds attendance record" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-Z4krt" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Z4krt/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="296"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
    </script>
    <p>The cup has been held by six other host nations since 1994, but none have been able to beat the record of 3.59 million spectators.</p>

    <p>Germany, which hosted in 2006, and Brazil, which played host in 2014, each came close with 3.36 million and 3.43 million respectively.</p>

    <p>But even with a relatively close margin, when you look at the average attendance per game throughout their respective tournaments, the United States is way ahead of the pack with the average attendance for the 52-game tournament at 68,991. Stadiums were filled to about 96% capacity in 1994.</p>

    <p>So, how does a country whose soccer fandom wasn't remarkable and hadn't even created its own domestic league manage to make and maintain world footballing history? One could argue that it's thanks to the very sport they prefer American football.</p>

    <iframe title="Stadiums at 1994-2018 World Cups:How many venues each, average capacity" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-xMbs9" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xMbs9/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="666"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
    </script>

    <p>When you look at the number of stadiums over the last seven cups, the U.S. pales in comparison to the rest with a mere nine, while Japan and South Korea, which played co-hosts in 2002, had more than double with a whopping 20. The 2002 World Cup saw the lowest attendance with 2.71 million spectators overall.</p>

    <p>But when you take a look at the stadium capacity at each cup, the U.S. again leads the pack. The stadiums in 1994 were not primarily soccer stadiums but rather National Football League and college football stadiums, which each had an average capacity of 68,968.</p>

    <p>The closest to that average was in the 2010 World Cup when South Africa played host with stadium capacity at an average 57,650.</p>

    </script>

    <p>Now, with the world making its way back to the U.S. for the biggest global sporting event, it's hard to believe it won't shatter its own record, as the tournament expands yet again from 32 teams to 48.</p>
